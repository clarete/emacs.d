* Emacs setup

  This repository contains my Emacs setup. Although these
  configurations are catered to my own taste, you might find a few
  things useful and improve the configuration of your Emacs too.

** What does it contain

   I'm an [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/][EXWM]] user, so one of the first things it sets up is a
   minimal desktop experience with dual monitor setup and a nice
   theme.  For the complete experience, it does depend on a few other
   files available on my [[https://github.com/clarete/dotfiles][dotdfiles]] repository though. Make sure you
   check it out too.

   It also sets up Org Mode, and some programming language
   environments, like Python, JavaScript, Rust, Lua and a few others.

   Here's a screenshot of me editing this file :)

** Install

   This is how you can get your Emacs to use this repository as the
   base for your configuration.

   #+begin_src bash
   $ git clone http://github.com/clarete/emacs.d
   $ ln -s $(pwd)/emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
   $ cd ~/.emacs.d && make
   #+end_src

   Running the ~make~ command will evoke the installation of
   [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) and all the Emacs extensions
   described in the `Cask` file.
